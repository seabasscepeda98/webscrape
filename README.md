Tax Deed Webscrape Project

This project utilizes the Selenium python library to automate website interaction by collecting and sorting tax deed data from subsites of putnamclerk.com on a monthly to semi-monthly basis. The script navigates through multiple dynamic PHP based web pages and JavaScript disclaimer prompts to access, copy and output relevant data into a single XLSX spreadsheet for further analysis and filtration.
