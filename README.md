Tax Deed Webscrape Project

This project utilizes python scripting to collect and sort tax deed auction data on a monthly to semi-monthly basis. The script navigates through multiple dynamic PHP based web pages and JavaScript disclaimer prompts to access, copy and output relevant data into a single XLSX spreadsheet for further analysis and filtration.
